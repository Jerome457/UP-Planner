https://pypi.org/project/up-spiderplan/0.3.4/#description
Follow the above link for installing spiderplan

For some reason after first installing 0.3.4 for spiderplan and then upgrading to 0.6.4 the import errors where resolved.

from up_spiderplan.solver import EngineImpl

from up_spiderplan.util import plot_path

update to this in test.py in test directory since we are using python 3.10



pip uninstall docker docker-compose requests urllib3 -y

sudo apt update
sudo apt install --reinstall docker-compose python3-docker python3-requests python3-urllib3
These packages should be there to prevent docker and python mismatch


For doing it again:
docker network prune -f
docker rm up-spiderplan-server-web
Since running the code runs docker compose again you need to delete the previousle made container to run it again
